> JHipster module, JHipster module for creating data obfuscation at rest with JPA support

# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) module, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application.

If you need to obfuscate the data before to store it then you are looking for this jhipster module!

When secret or sensitive data are stored on a database in clear text unauthorized people can potentially look at them and use this information inappropriately. You can obfuscate the fields of your entity using this jhipster module

*This field obfuscation is applicable only with JPA as persistence layer*

> **PAY ATTENTION**
> The used algorithms are very simple, if you want to improve the security you could re-implements the converters

# Prerequisites

As this is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) module, we expect you have JHipster and its related tools already installed:

yo jhipster-obfuscation-at-rest
```

The module will prompting about obfuscation during the JHipster generation entity
